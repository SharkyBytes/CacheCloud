# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix Applied - Port Permission Issue

## What Was Fixed

The server was trying to bind to `0.0.0.0:5000` which requires administrator privileges on Windows. I've fixed this by:

1. **Changed binding to localhost only** - More secure and doesn't need admin rights
2. **Changed default port from 5000 to 3000** - Less likely to have conflicts
3. **Added better error handling** - Clear messages when port issues occur
4. **Updated all configuration files** - Client now points to correct server URL

## How to Run Now

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
cd CacheCloud
npm run install-all
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: If You Still Have Port Issues
```bash
npm run fix-port
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Manual Port Change
Edit `server/.env` and change:
```env
PORT=8000  # or any available port
```

Then edit `client/.env` and change:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## New URLs

- **Client (Website)**: http://localhost:5173
- **Server (API)**: http://localhost:3000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3000/health

## Test Everything Works

```bash
npm test
```

## If You Still Have Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: Run `npm run fix-port` to find an available port
2. **Database Issues**: Make sure PostgreSQL is running
3. **Redis Issues**: Make sure Redis is running or use Docker: `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine`

## What Changed

- âœ… Server now binds to `localhost` instead of `0.0.0.0`
- âœ… Default port changed from 5000 to 3000
- âœ… Better error messages for port conflicts
- âœ… Automatic port finder tool (`npm run fix-port`)
- âœ… All documentation updated with new port numbers

The application should now start without permission issues! ðŸš€
